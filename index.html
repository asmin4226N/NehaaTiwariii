    Hey! This side neha. The girl who always believed and still believed to prove herself with her actions rather words! 
    She is completely different somewhere I myself can't understand her but the best part is she does whatever her 
    heart wants! She is funny, she is unpredictable,  she is just me.  
    She speaks with full confidence to make people around her confident, <i> “The secret to happiness is freedom and the secret to freedom is courage.”
     </i>said Thucydides , so she lives with a motto to live freely 
    and encourage others to live with full freedom! She is (I am) absolutely awesome.

<p class="am">Basically a 11th grader with lots of expectations on herself abt life and people's around her. She gets inspire by everything a
    round speak up whatever she feels! I believe in power of voice and peruse great interest in public speaking tho i dont
    have any good recognition.  I love to speak up and clear my perspective to people
    Good part is I know I'm not perfect neither anybody is but everybody around is good enough to have a positive vibe and respectful manner!!
